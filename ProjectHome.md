BlogSlideShow is a jQuery plugin enhancesing your blog pages with image viewer, which provides fancy transition effects.

BlogSlideShow comprises my library tEffects, which tries to apply CSS3 transitions to achive the effects. If the browser does not support CSS3, it visualizes the effects using JS. So the plugin is running effects as good as the browser can afford.

Likely you already have images on blog pages linked. Just add rel attribute containing "blogslideshow" to them.

When you click on such a link, you'll get the image viewer on the overlay. That contains toolbar by which you can navigate images. Besides, you can use keyboard arrows <-, ->, Esc as well.
